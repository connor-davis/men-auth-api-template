### Before running it!
Make sure that you have a .env file with the following

```

```

### How to run it?
- Clone the repository ```git clone https://github.com/connor-davis/men-auth-api-template```
- Run ```pnpm or npm install```
- Build css files ```pnpm or npm run build:css```
- Spin up the server with ```pnpm or npm start```

Once that is done, access the api docs from ```printedurl/api/v2/docs```

Thank you for using my software.
